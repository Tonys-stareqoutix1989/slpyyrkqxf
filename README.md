Dude, I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Flight Risk, and man, it's a wild ride. You know that moment when you're like, Should I even 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? but I totally did, and glad I did. It’s one of those where you're halfway through, and you think you’ve got it figured out, and then BAM! you're clueless again.

Seriously, I’m still kinda buzzing from it, both because it twisted my brain and because it’s late, and I should be in bed. Like, this pilot character, total loose cannon! At one point, I'm thinking he's heroic, and then next, I'm not so sure if he's just a nutjob. Keeps you guessing the whole time, not gonna lie.

Oh, and the plot! Every time you think it’s about to hit another gear, it just starts spinning in a whole new direction. It’s like, did the writers even know where it was going? Add to that some of the most random characters—I mean, there’s one guy that reminded me of my neighbor Ted, but after way too many espressos, ya know? 

> I'm wondering if I'd 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again. Not sure. But those aerial shots, they were something else! I'm sitting there thinking, I should just stick to driving. I mean, flying a plane when things go south is not on my bucket list. Surviving feels like an alternate universe for most of those characters. Anyway, it was a stress-fest, but in a good way?

Just remembered to mention, you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with someone next time, so you can both look at each other like “the heck was that?” at the same time. It’s a bonding experience, trust me. Made me wanna look into pilot lessons, then immediately reconsider knowing I can't even parallel park on a good day.

int pilotDecision = 0; // Total gibberish, don’t ask, haha.

Man, I should crash now, after “crashing at high altitudes with those characters. Alright, catch you later! Let me know what you think if you check it out too.
